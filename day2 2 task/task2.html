A career objective is a statement that outlines an individual's professional goals, aspirations, and the direction they want their career to take.

Career objectives should be tailored to the specific job or industry and should be clear, concise, and impactful. They provide employers with a quick snapshot of the candidate's professional ambitions and suitability for the role.
